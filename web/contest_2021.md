## Rules
About the build:
* Please follow the spirit of these rules, rather than the letter.
  If you're concerned about whether something will qualify, ask a member of the judge panel.
* The build must be a contraption that "does something" in Botania. Examples:
  * A Botania-powered tree farm
  * A fully-automated Entropinnyum setup
  * A high-chain-count Rafflowsia or Gourmaryllis setup
  * A corporea-integrated storage system that has a fancy availability display and automatically-recrafts missing items
  * A dynamic mana routing system based on recoloring sparks
  * ...Your imagination is the limit!
* The build must be completed on Botania version 416 or later. Only Botania and vanilla Minecraft content may be used in the build.
* The build must be theoretically possible (though not necessarily practical) to build in survival mode.
* Garden of Glass is allowed at your choice, but see the previous bullet.
* The build should be reasonably sized. This isn't to say massive builds are disallowed, but do not just submit your entire base as a "contraption".
* Abusing egregious glitches (duping) is not allowed.
* Datapacks are not allowed. Resource packs and shaders are allowed, but discouraged.

About the submission:
* Submissions may be made in your preferred medium (screenshot album, GIF, video). Please choose whichever you think will present your build in the best light.
* All submissions should be posted on the [Botania subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Botania).
  Additionally, please PM /u/williewillus a copy of your world.
Whether you publish your world otherwise is your choice.
* If you would like to share your submission elsewhere (for example, on /r/minecraft or /r/feedthebeast), feel free to crosspost your /r/Botania post into those subreddits.
* Submissions must be clearly marked as being entries for the build contest. Adding "[Botania build contest]" to the title will do.
* You may only submit one build, but you may replace your submission at any time during the submission window by following the steps above again.

Your build will be judged on the following aspects, in rough order of importance from most important to least important:
* Creativity: Does this build make use of vanilla and Botania mechanics in an interesting and innovative manner?
* Utility: Is this a build that would be useful to have in a world?
* Style and Coolness: Does this build make you think "wow, that's cool" when watching it run?
* Appearance: Is this build decorated nicely?
* Presentation: Does the submission post represent the build well?

## Prizes
The winning build will be featured on the Botania website homepage (you'll have to provide us a GIF of your build, if you didn't submit one),
and will also receive a $50 Steam gift card.<br />
The runner-up build will receive a $25 Steam gift card.<br />
Vazkii has promised $100 and eternal top-tier patron perks to the prize pool, how this will be divided is TBD.<br />
More prizes TBD.<br />
Both the winner and runner-up will also be given a Botania head-flower of their choice.<br />
Some honorable mentions may be given, which come with no prize besides bragging rights.

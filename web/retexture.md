# What?

Botania is getting a commissioned full retexture! Please help us fund this effort by
donating [here][fundraiser]!

# Why?

The current Botania textures were introduced in the 1.12 era, around 2017. Vanilla's
art style has changed since then, and while the current textures have lived a long
and colorful life, it is time to retire them for new textures that fit with the base game.

# Who?

The principal artists serving in this retexture are artemisSystem and Falkory220.
Some of their work has already made it into Botania, but they need your assistance to
fund the remaining textures. Botania is a massive mod so there's a lot of work to do!

# :how:

I (williewillus) have set up a GoFundMe at [this link][fundraiser] .
Treat the presence of this webpage as proof that the fundraiser is legitimate, as only
Botania maintainers can modify this website.

If excess funds remain after the retexture is complete, they will be donated to a
charity of the Violet Moon Modding team's choice. This donation will be announced
by the Violet Moon Twitter.
